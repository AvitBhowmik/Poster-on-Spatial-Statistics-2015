Weather and climate vary widely between locations, soil varies at every spatial scale at which it is examined, and even man-made attributes, such as the distribution of pollution, fluctuate significantly. To analyse the varied kinds of data and to predict at unvisited places from them, research scientists need to be familiar with the techniques of Geostatistics."
